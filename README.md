# mTRFpy - multivariate linear modeling

This is an adaptation of the matlab mTRF-toolbox using only basic Python and Numpy.
It aims to implement the same methods as the original toolbox and advance them.
This documentation provides tutorial-like demonstrations of the core functionalities like model fitting, visualization and optimization as well as a comprehensive reference documentation.


# Installation

You can get the stable release from PyPI:
```sh
    pip install mtrf 
```
    
Or get the latest version from this repo:
```sh
    pip install git+https://github.com/powerfulbean/mTRFpy.git
```

While mTRFpy only depends on numpy, matplotlib is an optional dependency used to
visualize models. It can also be installed via pip:

```sh
    pip install matplotlib
```

## Model Implementation Comparison

The core TRF model implementations are located in the `mtrf/` directory. This includes:
- `model.py`: Unified GPU-accelerated and CPU-compatible TRF implementation (formerly `model_gpu.py`)
- Supporting utilities for matrix operations and statistics

### Comparison Test Scripts
Two scripts are provided to compare the outputs, metrics, and weights of the TRF model implementations (CPU and GPU) to ensure correctness and reproducibility:

- `tests/compare_models.py`
- `tests/trf_compare.py`

**To run the comparison test on a cluster (SLURM/DCC):**

```bash
sbatch tests/run_compare_models.sh
```

This will execute one of the comparison scripts and output logs to the `log/` directory. The script prints detailed differences (if any) between the implementations. All results should match up to floating-point precision if the GPU backend is correct.

We also provide an optional interface to MNE-Python so it might be useful to [install mne](https://mne.tools/stable/install/manual_install.html) as well.
